## Slim PHP Framework Example

This demonstrates how to use the Slim micro-framework. The demo will evolve as I add more and more features. So far, features include:

 * Using Twig for templating
 * Using Mustache for templating
 * Connecting to Redis (using the Predis PHP library) to store key/value stores in memory.

### Install

Clone the repository and run ``` composer install ``` to install dependencies. (Requires you to install [composer](#install-composer-globally))

## Run

Then just spin up a localhost using PHP's built-in server

```
php -S localhost:8000
```

## Example routes


## Install Composer (globally)

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```
